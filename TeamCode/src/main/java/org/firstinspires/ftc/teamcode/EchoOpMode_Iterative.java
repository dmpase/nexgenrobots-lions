/**
 * This file contains an example of an iterative (Non-Linear) "OpMode".
 * An OpMode is a 'program' that runs in either the autonomous or the teleop period of an FTC match.
 * The names of OpModes appear on the menu of the FTC Driver Station.
 * When an selection is made from the menu, the corresponding OpMode
 * class is instantiated on the Robot Controller and executed.
 *
 * This particular OpMode just echoes input from the controllers.
 * It includes all the skeletal structure that all iterative OpModes contain.
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
